## Questions

### Active Speed Cubers

How many active (3x3x3) speedcubers are there registered with the WCA? For this question an *active speeedcuber* is defined as any person registered in the WCA who has competed in at least two competitions in the years 2022--2024. 


```{r}
## Create new dataset valid_competitions that will filter data for years 2022-2024 exclusively, then filter results for only valid competitions, filtering competition count greater than or less than 2

valid_competitions <- competitions |>
      filter(year >= 2022 & year <= 2024) |>
      select(id)

active_cubers <- results |>
      filter(competitionId %in% valid_competitions$id) |>
      group_by(personId) |>
      summarize(competition_count = n_distinct(competitionId)) |>
      filter(competition_count >= 2)
      nrow(active_cubers)
```

**There are a total of 39482 speedcubers who have competed in at least two competitions in the years 2022-2024.**

### World Records

This question has two parts:

1. Who holds the current world record single? 

```{r}
## joining results data to rankssingle data to collect names and arrange the names from best score to worst score and selecting the name of record holder with their rank and competitionId, returning the first row using slice function and returning the data using head function

world_record_holder <- rankssingle |>
      arrange(best) |>
      left_join(results, by = c('best', 'personId', 'eventId')) |>
      select(personName, worldRank, competitionId) |>
      slice(1)
      head(world_record_holder)

```

**Max Park holds the current world record single of a best score of 313.**


On what date was this record set?


```{r}
## filtering the id's of competitions dataset of the record holder's competitionId and selecting the year, month, and day of the row with the corresponding competitionId and returning the data using head function

world_record_date <- competitions |>
      filter(id == world_record_holder$competitionId) |>
      select(year, month, day)
      head(world_record_date)

```

**The record was set on 6/11/2023.**



2. Who *previously* held the world record single? On what date was this previous record set?

```{r}
## Arrange the best times then join necessary tables to have the date, name, and competitionId correspond to each other, then using filter function to condition the year, month, day, to find the time before the current world record date, then save the information of the previous record holder name, best time, competitionId, and time in the prev_world_record_holder dataset and return it using the head function and slice to extract the first row of the dataset

prev_world_record_holder <- rankssingle |>
      arrange(best) |>
      left_join(results, by = c('best', 'personId', 'eventId')) |>
      left_join(competitions, by = c('competitionId' = 'id')) |>
      filter(year < world_record_date$year | 
               (year == world_record_date$year & month < world_record_date$month) | 
               (year == world_record_date$year & month == world_record_date$month & day < world_record_date$day)) |>
      select(personName, best, competitionId, year, month, day) |>
      slice(1)
      head(prev_world_record_holder)
```

**Yusheng Du previously held the world record single, set on 11/24/2018.**


### Regional Rankings

This question has two parts:

1. Amongst all speedcubers, who is the top ranked male speedcuber (for best single solve) in Australia?

```{r}
## Add your code here

```

**Write your answer here.**


2. Amongst all speedcubers, who is the top ranked female speedcuber (for best single solve time) in Europe?

```{r}
## Add your code here

```

**Write your answer here.**



### Time Until Sub-5

Having a time below 5 seconds is considered an elite achievement and most speedcubers have to complete a large number of solves before they can obtain a sub-5 second solve. 

**NOTE**: Each round of a competition has 5 solves that should be considered separately when counting the number of solves.


1. For the current top 10 speedcubers in the world (as recorded in the RanksSingle table), on average, how many solves did they have to do before achieving a sub-5 second solve?


```{r}
## Add your code here

```

**Write your answer here.**



2. For **one** of the top 10 speedcubers make a plot of their solve times vs. the date of the solve, with date on the x-axis and solve time on the y-axis. 


```{r}
## Add your code here

```


**Write your answer here.**


### Up-and-Coming Speed Cubers

Which speed cubers **not** in the top 10,000 (worldwide for single best time) should we keep an eye on for the near future? 

The idea here is to identify "up-and-coming" speedcubers who are not yet achieving elite times. Come up with a list of **five** speedcubers (provide their names and WCA IDs) that you have identified as "up-and-coming". There is no one way to answer this question and the goal is to provide an analysis of the data that justifies the selection of your five names.

```{r}
## Add your code here


```

**Write your answer here.**



### Region Rivalries

Europe and North America are both regions with strong speedcubers in the WCA. 

Which region has the faster group of speedcubers on average? 

To answer this question, characterize each person using their best *average* score according to their listing in the `ranksaverage` table. In the `persons` table the `countryId` indicates each person's country affiliation. The `countries` table lists the region that each country is in via the `continentId` column (Europe is "_Europe" and North America is "_North America").

Before attempting to answer the question, state what you expect the answer to be below.

**Write your expectation here.**



```{r}
## Add your code here

```

What do you conclude about speedcubers in Europe vs. North America?

**Write you answer here.**


### Alternative Explanations

Develop an alternative explanation/hypothesis regarding speedcubers from Europe and North America that is 

1. Consistent with the results you produced in the previous question; but

2. Provides a different interpretation or explanation for what is going on. 

If the results from the previous question were unexpected, make use of systems thinking to develop an alternative hypothesis. If the results were consistent with your expectations, then use skeptical thinking. In either case, you should present an analysis that shows evidence for or against this alternative explanation relative to the conclusion that you made in the previous question.

**State your alternative explanation here.**

```{r}
## Add your code here

```

**Summarize the results of your alternative analysis here.**
